## 7. Algorithm Analysis Techniques

### 1. Time Complexity
- Time complexity describes how the runtime of an algorithm increases with the size of the input.
- Helps evaluate the efficiency of algorithms.
- Common complexities:
  - **O(1)** – Constant time
  - **O(log n)** – Logarithmic time
  - **O(n)** – Linear time
  - **O(n log n)** – Linearithmic time
  - **O(n²)** – Quadratic time
  - **O(2ⁿ), O(n!)** – Exponential time

### 2. Asymptotic Notation
- Used to describe the upper, lower, or tight bound behavior of an algorithm:
  - **Big O (O)** – Worst-case upper bound  
    Example: O(n²) means the runtime grows at most as n².
  - **Big Omega (Ω)** – Best-case lower bound  
    Example: Ω(n) means the algorithm takes at least linear time.
  - **Big Theta (Θ)** – Tight bound (both upper and lower)  
    Example: Θ(n log n) means the runtime grows exactly at that rate.

### 3. Substitution Method
- A method to solve recurrence relations by guessing the form of the solution and proving it using mathematical induction.
- **Example:**
  - T(n) = 2T(n/2) + n  
  - Guess: T(n) = O(n log n)  
  - Prove the guess using induction.

### 4. Iteration Method
- Solves recurrence relations by expanding them step by step until a pattern is observed.
- **Example:**
  - T(n) = T(n/2) + n  
  - T(n/2) = T(n/4) + n/2  
  - …
  - Total = n + n/2 + n/4 + … = O(n)

### 5. Master Theorem
- Provides a direct way to analyze the time complexity of divide-and-conquer algorithms.
- Applies to recurrences of the form:  
  **T(n) = aT(n/b) + f(n)**  
- **Cases:**
  1. If f(n) = O(n^log_b(a - ε)) → T(n) = Θ(n^log_b(a))
  2. If f(n) = Θ(n^log_b(a)) → T(n) = Θ(n^log_b(a) * log n)
  3. If f(n) = Ω(n^log_b(a + ε)) and regularity condition holds → T(n) = Θ(f(n))
- **Example:**
  - Merge Sort: T(n) = 2T(n/2) + n → Case 2 → Θ(n log n)


  ## 8. Tree, Binary Tree, Binary Search Tree

### 1. Tree
- A **tree** is a hierarchical data structure consisting of nodes.
- The top node is called the **root**; nodes without children are called **leaves**.
- Each node (except the root) has exactly one parent.
- Trees are used in many applications like file systems, databases, and parsing expressions.
- **Terminology:**
  - **Parent, Child, Sibling**
  - **Subtree**: A tree formed by a node and its descendants.
  - **Depth**: Number of edges from root to node.
  - **Height**: Number of edges on the longest path from node to a leaf.

### 2. Binary Tree
- A **binary tree** is a tree where each node has at most two children: **left** and **right**.
- Types of binary trees:
  - **Full Binary Tree**: Every node has 0 or 2 children.
  - **Complete Binary Tree**: All levels are filled except possibly the last, which is filled from left to right.
  - **Perfect Binary Tree**: All internal nodes have two children and all leaves are at the same level.
- Common traversals:
  - **Inorder (Left, Root, Right)**
  - **Preorder (Root, Left, Right)**
  - **Postorder (Left, Right, Root)**
  - **Level-order (Breadth-First Search)**

### 3. Binary Search Tree (BST)
- A **Binary Search Tree** is a binary tree with the property:
  - For any node `n`:  
    - All values in the left subtree < `n.value`  
    - All values in the right subtree > `n.value`
- Operations:
  - **Search**: O(h) time complexity (h = tree height)
  - **Insert**: O(h)
  - **Delete**: O(h)
- Best case: **Balanced BST** → O(log n)  
- Worst case: **Unbalanced BST** (like a linked list) → O(n)
- BSTs are used in:
  - Dynamic sets
  - Searching and sorting
  - Dictionary implementations
